If your speed sensor is not working:

1. Check if the the black and white disk is scratched. The sensor is VERY 
sensitive to scratches. Wear in the motor bearings can cause the encoder 
disk to contact the opto-switches causing damage to both.

2. Check your connectors, there are a lot in the encoder path, none of which 
are rated for an automotive environment.

3. Check the rotation sense select switch in the motor controller. The encoder 
signal is routed through it.

4. Check LED's on encoder board for operation with power applied and encoder 
disk spinning. These are very faint but can be seen in the dark.

5. Check that the motor controller reports the correct encoder signals (GZ*) 
if you have amcmon.exe connected to the motor controller serial port.
